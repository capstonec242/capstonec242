# **Tabungin App**
Capstone Project Team C242-PS208

## **Background**
Our team developed this project after recognizing the common struggle many people face with achieving savings targets due to a lack of consistent tracking tools. We realized that without a reliable system to monitor progress, it's easy for financial goals to fall by the wayside. Inspired by our own experiences, we wanted to create an app that would not only assist us but also benefit others facing similar financial challenges. By building a user-friendly and efficient tool, we aim to make financial management and goal-setting more accessible and achievable for everyone.
